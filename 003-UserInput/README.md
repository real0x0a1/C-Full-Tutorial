```c
#include <stdio.h>
```

This line includes a standard input-output library (`stdio.h`) in the program. It provides functions like `printf` and `scanf` that are used for input and output operations.

```c
int main() {
```

This line is the starting point of the program. It declares the main function, which is the entry point of every C program. The `int` before `main()` indicates that the function returns an integer value.

```c
    // Variables
    int num1, num2;
```

Here, we declare two integer variables, `num1` and `num2`. Variables are used to store data in a program. In this case, we'll use these variables to store the numbers entered by the user.

```c
    // User input
    printf("Enter number 1: ");
    scanf("%d", &num1);

    printf("Enter number 2: ");
    scanf("%d", &num2);
```

The `printf` function is used to print a message to the console, asking the user to enter a number. The `%d` is a format specifier that tells `printf` to expect an integer input. The `scanf` function is then used to read the integer input from the user and store it in the respective variables (`&num1` and `&num2`). The `&` operator is used to get the memory address of the variables.

```c
    // Display input
    printf("Numbers entered: %d and %d\n", num1, num2);
```

After getting the user input, this line uses `printf` again to display the numbers entered by the user. The `%d` placeholders in the format string are replaced by the values of `num1` and `num2`.

```c
    return 0;
```

Finally, the `return 0;` statement indicates that the program has executed successfully. The `0` typically signifies that the program terminated without any errors.

To summarize, this program prompts the user to enter two numbers, stores those numbers in variables, and then displays the entered numbers on the console. It's a simple example to demonstrate basic input and output operations in C.

## How to Run

To run this program:

1. Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your computer.
2. Copy the code into a file with a `.c` extension, for example, `userinput.c`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your file is located.
4. Compile the program by entering: `gcc userinput.c -o userinput`
5. Run the compiled program: `./userinput`

Or you can run this program also using:

```bash
   make userinput
```
