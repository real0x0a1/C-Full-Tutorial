Certainly! Let's break down this C code for beginners:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function declaration
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int multiply(int a, int b) {
    return a * b;
}

// Main function
int main() {
    // Function calls
    int sum = add(5, 3);
    int result = multiply(4, 6);

    // Display results
    printf("Sum: %d\n", sum);
    printf("Result: %d\n", result);

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`#include <stdio.h>`:**
   - This line includes the standard input/output library, allowing you to use functions like `printf` and `scanf`.

2. **Function Declarations:**
   - `int add(int a, int b)`: Declares a function named `add` that takes two integers as parameters (`a` and `b`) and returns an integer.
   - `int multiply(int a, int b)`: Declares a function named `multiply` with similar characteristics.

3. **Function Definitions:**
   - Inside the `main.c` file, the actual code for the `add` and `multiply` functions is not written, but their declarations tell the compiler that these functions exist and what type of values they return.

4. **Main Function:**
   - `int main() { ... }`: This is the main function where the program execution begins. The `{` and `}` curly braces define the start and end of the `main` function.

5. **Function Calls:**
   - `int sum = add(5, 3);`: Calls the `add` function with arguments `5` and `3` and assigns the result to the variable `sum`.
   - `int result = multiply(4, 6);`: Calls the `multiply` function with arguments `4` and `6` and assigns the result to the variable `result`.

6. **Displaying Results:**
   - `printf("Sum: %d\n", sum);`: Prints the value of `sum`.
   - `printf("Result: %d\n", result);`: Prints the value of `result`.

7. **`return 0;`:**
   - Indicates that the program executed successfully. The `0` here is a convention for indicating a successful execution.

In summary, this program demonstrates the use of functions in C. It declares two functions (`add` and `multiply`), calls them in the `main` function, and displays the results. Functions help in organizing code by allowing you to break it into modular and reusable parts.

## How to Run

To run this program:

1. Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your computer.
2. Copy the code into a file with a `.c` extension, for example, `functions.c`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your file is located.
4. Compile the program by entering: `gcc functions.c -o functions`
5. Run the compiled program: `./functions`

Or you can run this program also using:

```bash
   make functions
```
