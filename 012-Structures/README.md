Let's break it down step by step:

1. `#include <stdio.h>`: This line includes the standard input-output header file, which is necessary for functions like `printf` and `strcpy`.

2. `struct Student { char name[50]; int age; float gpa; };`: This line defines a structure named `Student`. A structure is a user-defined data type that can hold multiple variables of different types under one name. In this case, a `Student` structure has three members: `name` (an array of characters to store the name), `age` (an integer to store the age), and `gpa` (a floating-point number to store the grade point average).

3. `int main() {`: This is the starting point of the program. The `main` function is the entry point of every C program.

4. `struct Student student1;`: This declares a variable named `student1` of type `struct Student`. It creates an instance of the `Student` structure, which can hold data for a specific student.

5. `strcpy(student1.name, "Ali");`: This line copies the string "Ali" into the `name` member of the `student1` structure. The `strcpy` function is used to copy strings in C.

6. `student1.age = 20;`: Assigns the value 20 to the `age` member of the `student1` structure.

7. `student1.gpa = 3.8;`: Assigns the value 3.8 to the `gpa` member of the `student1` structure.

8. `printf("Student Name: %s\n", student1.name);`: Prints the student's name using the `printf` function. The `%s` is a format specifier for a string.

9. `printf("Age: %d\n", student1.age);`: Prints the age of the student using the `%d` format specifier for integers.

10. `printf("GPA: %.2f\n", student1.gpa);`: Prints the GPA of the student using the `%f` format specifier for floating-point numbers. The `.2` specifies that only two decimal places should be displayed.

11. `return 0;`: Indicates that the program executed successfully and returns 0 to the operating system.

In summary, this program defines a `Student` structure, creates an instance of it (student1), assigns values to its members, and then prints out the information about the student (name, age, and GPA).

# How to Run

To run this program:

1. Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your computer.
2. Copy the code into a file with a `.c` extension, for example, `structures.c`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your file is located.
4. Compile the program by entering: `gcc structures.c -o structures`
5. Run the compiled program: `./structures`

Or you can run this program also using:

```bash
   make structures
```
