# Hello, World! in C

## Overview

Provide a brief overview of your project that is language-neutral.


## Overview

This simple C program is the classic "Hello, World!" example, often used to introduce beginners to a new programming language. The purpose of this program is to display the message "Hello, World!" on the screen.

## Code Explanation

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

- `#include <stdio.h>`: This line tells the compiler to include a library called `stdio.h`, which stands for Standard Input/Output. This library provides functions for input and output operations, such as printing to the screen.

- `int main() { ... }`: This is the main function of our program. All C programs start executing from the `main` function. The `{` and `}` curly braces define the beginning and end of the function's body.

- `printf("Hello, World!\n");`: This line is responsible for printing the text "Hello, World!" to the console. The `printf` function is part of the `stdio.h` library and is used for formatted output. In this case, it simply outputs the specified text.

- `return 0;`: The `main` function ends with `return 0;`. This line indicates that the program has executed successfully. The `0` here is a convention in C to signal a successful execution. Other numbers can be used to indicate different exit statuses.

## How to Run

To run this program:

1. Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your computer.
2. Copy the code into a file with a `.c` extension, for example, `helloworld.c`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your file is located.
4. Compile the program by entering: `gcc helloworld.c -o helloworld`
5. Run the compiled program: `./helloworld`

Or you can run this program also using:

```bash
   make helloworld
```

You should see the output: "Hello, World!" on your screen.

Congratulations! You've just run your first C program. Feel free to explore more C programming concepts and build on this foundation. Happy coding! ðŸš€
