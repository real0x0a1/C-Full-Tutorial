1. **Include Header Files:**
   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <string.h>
   ```
   These lines include necessary header files. `<stdio.h>` is for standard input/output operations, and `<string.h>` is for string manipulation functions.

2. **Main Function:**
   ```c
   int main() {
   ```
   This is the starting point of the program. In C, every program must have a `main` function, and the execution begins from here.

3. **Declare Variables:**
   ```c
   char greeting[20] = "Hello, ";
   char name[10];
   ```
   - `greeting` is an array of characters (a string) with a size of 20 characters. It is initialized with the string "Hello, ".
   - `name` is another array of characters with a size of 10 characters. This will be used to store the user's name.

4. **Get User Input:**
   ```c
   printf("Enter your name: ");
   scanf("%s", name);
   ```
   - `printf` is used to display a message asking the user to enter their name.
   - `scanf` is used to take input from the user. `%s` is the format specifier for a string, and it reads the input into the `name` variable.

5. **Concatenate Strings:**
   ```c
   strcat(greeting, name);
   ```
   `strcat` function is used to concatenate (append) the contents of `name` to the end of `greeting`. After this line, `greeting` will contain "Hello, " followed by the user's name.

6. **Display Concatenated String:**
   ```c
   printf("%s\n", greeting);
   ```
   `printf` is used again to display the concatenated string (`greeting`) on the screen.

7. **String Length:**
   ```c
   printf("Length of the string: %lu\n", strlen(greeting));
   ```
   - `strlen` is a function that returns the length of a string.
   - `%lu` is the format specifier for an unsigned long integer, used to print the length of the string.
   - This line prints the length of the concatenated string (`greeting`).

8. **Return Statement:**
   ```c
   return 0;
   ```
   The `main` function returns an integer value. By convention, a return value of 0 indicates successful execution.

9. **End of Program:**
   ```c
   }
   ```
   This closing brace marks the end of the `main` function and the end of the C program.

# How to Run

To run this program:

1. Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your computer.
2. Copy the code into a file with a `.c` extension, for example, `strings.c`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your file is located.
4. Compile the program by entering: `gcc strings.c -o strings`
5. Run the compiled program: `./strings`

Or you can run this program also using:

```bash
   make strings
```
